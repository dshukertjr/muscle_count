# Workout Tracker

Workout Tracker is an app that will keep track of your workout history. 

Open the app and at the bottom of the app there are three text boxes. 
After you complete a workout, fill out the name of the workout, and optionally fill out the weight and number of sets you completed. 
Press the submit button and it will keep the record for the workout you completed. 

If you press on one of the workout from the list, you can view a chart of the progress you have made with that particular workout. The y-axis of the chart is volume(weight times number of sets) or just the weight or the number of sets if either one were missing.
